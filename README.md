# DEVELOPER-MEET-UP-APPLICATION-MERN-STACK-

I have developed this applicaiton using MERN STACK
MERN STACK means Mongodb, Express, React and node

I have used Redux also for state management, it is just easy !!!

I have created all Rest API and tested them using postman, then created my front end using react where i have created various components, reducers and actions along with passport.js for login/signup and validated form fields using validator

For every single routes, i have made use of promises, it is always easy to handle asynchronous operations using promises.
i have also fetched git respsitory using api.github
